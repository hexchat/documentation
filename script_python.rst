HexChat Python Interface
========================

.. default-domain:: py

Features
--------

Here are some of the features of the python plugin interface:

-  Comprehensive, consistent and straightforward API
-  Load, unload, reload, and autoload support
-  Per plugin independent interpreter state
-  Python interactive console
-  Python interactive command execution
-  Python 2 and 3 support (2.9.6+)
-  Full thread support (except for Python2 on Windows)
-  Stdout and stderr redirected to HexChat console
-  Dynamic list management
-  Nice context treatment
-  Plugin preferences


Python 2 or Python 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of HexChat 2.9.6 the plugin supports both so which should you pick:

As a user most older scripts will not be updated for Python 3 so 2 is your best bet.

As a developer I would just recommend you make your scripts compatible for both but do note that
Python 2 on Windows does not support threads while Python 3 does.

Commands
--------

The Python plugin comes with a :command:`py` command that takes these arguments.

.. program:: py

.. option:: load <file>

	Load a script with given filename.
	:command:`/load` will also work.

.. option:: unload <filename\|module name>

	Unload module with given filename, or module name.
	:command:`/unload` will also work.

.. option:: reload <filename\|module name>

	Reload module with given filename, or module name.
	:command:`/reload` will also work.

.. option:: list

	List Python scripts loaded

.. option:: exec <command>

	Execute given Python command interactively. For example:

	 /py exec import hexchat; print(hexchat.get_info('channel'))

.. option:: console

	Open the Python interactive console in a query
	``>>python<<``. Every message sent will be intercepted by the Python
	plugin interface, and interpreted interactively. Notice that the
	console and /py exec commands live in the same interpreter state.

.. option:: about

	Show some information about the Python plugin interface.

Autoloading modules
-------------------

If you want some module to be autoloaded together with the Python plugin
interface (which usually loads at startup time), just make sure it has a
``.py`` extension and put it in the :file:`addons` subdir
of HexChat's `config directory <settings.html#config-files>`_.

Context theory
--------------

Before starting to explain what the API offers, I'll do a short
introduction about the HexChat context concept. Not because it's
something hard to understand, but because you'll understand better the
API explanations if you know what I'm talking about.

You can think about a context as an HexChat channel, server, or query
tab. Each of these tabs, has its own context, and is related to a given
server and channel (queries are a special kind of channel).

The *current* context is the one where HexChat passes control to the
module. For example, when HexChat receives a command in a specific
channel, and you have asked HexChat to tell you about this event, the
current context will be set to this channel before your module is
called.

Text Formatting
---------------

- Bold: '\\002'
- Color: '\\003'
- Hidden: '\\010'
- Underline: '\\037'
- Original Color: '\\017'
- Reverse Color: '\\026'
- Beep: '\\007'
- Italics: '\\035' (2.9.7+)

For example this will print underlined red text:

.. code-block:: python

   print('\037\00304Text!')

Hello world
-----------

Here is the traditional *hello world* example.

.. code-block:: python

   __module_name__ = "helloworld"
   __module_version__ = "1.0"
   __module_description__ = "Python module example"

   print("Hello world!")

This module will print "Hello world!" in the HexChat console, and sleep
forever until it's unloaded. It's a simple module, but already
introduces some concepts. Notice how the module information is set. This
information is obligatory, and will be shown when listing the loaded
HexChat modules.

.. module:: hexchat

xchat module
------------

The xchat module is your passport to every HexChat functionality offered
by the Python plugin interface. Here's a simple example:

.. code-block:: python

   import hexchat
   hexchat.prnt("Hi everyone!")

The following functions are available in the hexchat module.

Constants and Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: PRI_HIGHEST
		  PRI_HIGH
		  PRI_NORM
		  PRI_LOW
		  PRI_LOWEST

	Priority given to hooks.

.. data:: EAT_PLUGIN
		  EAT_HEXCHAT
		  EAT_ALL
		  EAT_NONE

	Used as return values for callbacks.

.. attribute:: __version__

	Tuple of (MAJOR_VERSION, MINOR_VERSION)

Generic functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: prnt(string)

	This function will print string in the current context. It's mainly
	useful as a parameter to pass to some other function, since the usual
	print statement will have the same results. You have a usage example
	above.

	This function is badly named because ``"print"`` is a reserved keyword
	of the Python language.

.. function:: emit_print(event_name, *args)

	This function will generate a *print event* with the given arguments. To
	check which events are available, and the number and meaning of
	arguments, have a look at the :menuselection:`Settings --> Text Events` window.
	Here is one example:

	.. code-block:: python

		hexchat.emit_print("Channel Message", "John", "Hi there", "@")

	With plugin version 1.0+ this function takes Keywords for certain :obj:`Attributes` such as *time*

.. function:: command(string)

	Execute the given command in the current :obj:`context`. This has the same
	results as executing a command in the HexChat window, but notice that
	the ``/`` prefix is not used. Here is an example:

	.. code-block:: python

	   hexchat.command("server irc.openprojects.net")

.. function:: nickcmp(s1, s2)

	This function will do an RFC1459 compliant string comparison
	and is useful to compare channels and nicknames.

	:returns: Returns 0 if they match and less than or greater than 0 if s1 is less than or greather than s2

	.. code-block:: python

	   if hexchat.nickcmp(nick, "mynick") == 0:
		   print("They are the same!")

.. function:: strip(text[, length=-1, flags=3])

	This function can strip colors and attributes from text.

	:param length: -1 for entire string
	:param flags:
		1: Strip Colors
		2: Strip Attributes
		3: Strip All
	:returns: Stripped String

	.. code-block:: python

		text = '\00304\002test' # Bold red text
		print(text)
		print(hexchat.strip(text, len(text), 1)) # Bold uncolored text

Information retreiving functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: get_info(type)

	Retrieve the information specified by the ``type`` string in the current
	context. At the moment of this writing, the following information types
	are available to be queried:

	-  **away:** Away reason or None if you are not away.
	-  **channel:** Channel name of the current context.
	-  **charset:** Charset in current context.
	-  **configdir:** HexChat config directory e.g.: "~/.config/hexchat".
	-  **event\_text NAME:** Returns text event string for requested event.
	-  **gtkwin\_ptr:** Returns hex representation of the pointer to the current Gtk window.
	-  **host:** Real hostname of the server you connected to.
	-  **inputbox:** Contents of inputbox.
	-  **network:** Current network name or None.
	-  **nick:** Your current nick name.
	-  **nickserv:** Current networks nickserv password or None.
	-  **modes:** Current channel modes or None.
	-  **server:** Current server name (what the server claims to be) or
	   None if you are not connected.
	-  **topic:** Current channel topic.
	-  **win\_status:** Returns status of window: 'active', 'hidden', or
	   'normal'.
	-  **version:** HexChat version number.

	Example:

	.. code-block:: python

	   if hexchat.get_info("server") == 'freenode':
		   hexchat.prnt('connected!')

.. function:: get_prefs(name)

	Retrieve the HexChat setting information specified by the ``name``
	string, as available by the ``/set`` command.

	.. code-block:: python

	   print("Current preferred nick: " + hexchat.get_prefs("irc_nick1"))

	You can also get the format of Text Events by using *event_name* and the event:

	.. code-block:: python

	   print(hexchat.get_prefs("event_name Channel Message"))

	And on top of that there are a few special preferences:

	- id (unique server id)
	- state_cursor (location of cursor in input box)


.. function:: get_list(type)

	With this function you may retrieve a list containing the selected
	information from the current context, like a DCC list, a channel list, a
	user list, etc. Each list item will have its attributes set dynamically
	depending on the information provided by the list type.

	The example below is a rewrite of the example provided with HexChat's
	plugin API documentation. It prints a list of every DCC transfer
	happening at the moment. Notice how similar the interface is to the C
	API provided by HexChat.

	.. code-block:: python

	   list = hexchat.get_list("dcc")
	   if list:
		   print("--- DCC LIST ------------------")
		   print("File  To/From   KB/s   Position")
		   for i in list:
			   print("%6s %10s %.2f  %d" % (i.file, i.nick, i.cps/1024, i.pos))

	Below you will find what each list type has to offer.

Hook functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These functions allow one to hook into HexChat events.

Parameters
''''''''''

callback
^^^^^^^^

A callback is the function that will be called when the event happens.

The callback supposed to return one of the EAT\_\* `constants <script_python.html#constants-and-attributes>`_,
it is able control how HexChat will proceed after the callback returns. These
are the available constants, and their meanings:

-  :data:`EAT_PLUGIN`: Don't let any other plugin receive this event.
-  :data:`EAT_HEXCHAT`: Don't let HexChat treat this event as usual.
-  :data:`EAT_ALL`: Eat the event completely.
-  :data:`EAT_NONE`: Let everything happen as usual.

.. Note:: Returning ``None`` is the same as returning :data:`EAT\_NONE`.

userdata
^^^^^^^^

The parameter userdata, if given, allows you to pass a custom object to
your callback.

attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

If you create a hook with :func:`hook_server_attrs` or :func:`hook_print_attrs` the last
argument in the callback will be an :obj:`Attribute` object.

.. object:: Attribute

	.. attribute:: Attribute.time

		The time the event occurred (from server-time) or 0

priority
^^^^^^^^

When a priority keyword parameter is accepted, it means that this
callback may be hooked with five different priorities which are
`constants <script_python.html#constants-and-attributes>`_ will define the
order in which your plugin will be called. Most of the time, you won't
want to change its default value (:data:`PRI_NORM`).

word and word\_eol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These parameters, when available in a callback, are lists of strings
which contain the parameters the user entered for the particular
command. For example, if you executed:

 /command NICK Hi there!

-  **word[0]** is ``command``
-  **word[1]** is ``NICK``
-  **word[2]** is ``Hi``
-  **word[3]** is ``there!``
-  **word\_eol[0]** is ``command NICK Hi there!``
-  **word\_eol[1]** is ``NICK Hi there!``
-  **word\_eol[2]** is ``Hi there!``
-  **word\_eol[3]** is ``there!``

.. function:: hook_command(name, callback[, userdata=None, priority=PRI_NORM, help=None])

	This function allows you to hook into the name HexChat command. It means
	that everytime you type ``/name ...``, ``callback`` will be called.
	Parameters ``userdata`` and ``priority`` have their meanings explained
	above, and the parameter help, if given, allows you to pass a help text
	which will be shown when ``/help name`` is executed.

	:returns: New Hook Handler

	.. code-block:: python

	   def onotice_cb(word, word_eol, userdata):
		   if len(word) < 2:
			   print("Second arg must be the message!")
		   else:
			   hexchat.command("NOTICE @{} {}".format(hexchat.get_info("channel"), word_eol[1]))
		   return hexchat.EAT_ALL

	   hexchat.hook_command("ONOTICE", onotice_cb, help="/ONOTICE <message> Sends a notice to all ops")

	You may return one of ``EAT_*`` constants in the callback, to control
	HexChat's behavior, as explained above.

.. function:: hook_print(name, callback[, userdata=None, priority=PRI_NORM])

	This function allows you to register a callback to trap any print
	events. The event names are available in the :menuselection:`Settings --> Text Events` window.
	Parameters ``userdata`` and ``priority`` have their meanings explained
	above.

	:returns: New Hook Handler

	.. code-block:: python

	   def youpart_cb(word, word_eol, userdata):
		   print("You have left channel " + word[2])
		   return hexchat.EAT_HEXCHAT # Don't let HexChat do its normal printing

	   hexchat.hook_print("You Part", youpart_cb)

	Along with Text Events there are a handfull of *special* events you can hook with this:

	- **Open Context**: Called when a new context is created.
	- **Close Context**: Called when a context is closed.
	- **Focus Tab**: Called when a tab is brought to front.
	- **Focus Window**: Called a toplevel window is focused, or the main tab-window is focused by the window manager.
	- **DCC Chat Text**: Called when some text from a DCC Chat arrives. It provides these elements in the word list:
	   - Address
	   - Port
	   - Nick
	   - Message
	- **Key Press**: Called when some keys are pressed in the input box. It provides these elements in the word list:
	   - Key Value
	   - State Bitfield (shift, capslock, alt)
	   - String version of the key
	   - Length of the string (may be 0 for unprintable keys)

.. function:: hook_print_attrs(name, callback[, userdata=None, priority=PRI_NORM])

	This function is the same as :func:`hook_print` except its callback will have a new
	:obj:`Attribute` argument.

	:returns: New Hook Handler

	.. versionadded:: 1.0

	.. code-block:: python

				return hexchat.EAT_HEXCHAT

		hexchat.hook_print_attrs("You Part", youpart_cb)

.. function:: hook_server(name, callback[, userdata=None, priority=PRI_NORM])

	This function allows you to register a callback to be called when a
	certain server event occurs. You can use this to trap ``PRIVMSG``,
	``NOTICE``, ``PART``, a server numeric, etc. Parameters ``userdata`` and
	``priority`` have their meanings explained above.

	:returns: New Hook Handler

	.. code-block:: python

		def kick_cb(word, word_eol, userdata):

				return hexchat.EAT_NONE

	   hexchat.hook_server_attrs("KICK", kick_cb)

.. function:: hook_timer(timeout, callback[, userdata=None])

	This function allows you to register a callback to be called every
	timeout milliseconds. Parameters userdata and priority have their
	meanings explained above.

	:returns: New Hook Handler

			   hexchat.unhook(myhook)
			   myhook = None
			   print("Timeout removed!")

	   def timeout_cb(userdata):
		   print("Annoying message every 5 seconds! Type /STOP to stop it.")
		   return 1 # Keep the timeout going

	   myhook = hexchat.hook_timer(5000, timeout_cb)
	   hexchat.hook_command("STOP", stop_cb)

	If you return a true value from the callback, the timer will be keeped,
	otherwise it is removed.

.. function:: hook_unload(timeout, callback[, userdata=None])

	This function allows you to register a callback to be called when the
	plugin is going to be unloaded. Parameters ``userdata`` and ``priority``

	Stores settings in addon\_python.conf in the config dir.

	:returns:
		- False: Failure
		- True: Success

	.. versionadded:: 0.9

	.. Note:: Until the plugin uses different a config file per script it's
			  recommened to use 'scriptname_settingname' to avoid conflicts.

.. function:: get_pluginpref(name)

	This will return the value of the variable of that name. If there is
	none by this name it will return ``None``.

	:returns: String or Integer of stored setting or None if it does not exist.

	.. Note:: Strings of numbers are always returned as Integers.

	.. versionadded:: 0.9

	Returns a list of all currently set preferences.

	:rtype: List of Strings

	.. versionadded:: 0.9

Context handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below you will find information about how to work with contexts.

Context objects
'''''''''''''''

As explained in the Context theory session above, contexts give access
to a specific channel/query/server tab of HexChat. Every function
available in the xchat module will be evaluated in the current context,
which will be specified by HexChat itself before passing control to the
module. Sometimes you may want to work in a specific context, and that's
where :obj:`context` objects come into play.

You may create a context object using :func:`get_context` or :func:`find_context`
functions as explained below, or trough the :func:`get_list` function, as explained above.


.. function:: get_context()

	:rtype: :obj:`context`

.. function:: find_context(server=None, channel=None)

	Finds a context based on a channel and servername.

	:keyword server: if None only looks for channel name
	:keyword channel: if None looks for front context of given server
	:rtype: :obj:`context`

	.. code-block:: python

	   cnc = hexchat.find_context(channel='#conectiva')
	   cnc.command('whois niemeyer')


.. object:: context

	The context object returned by the functions listed above has these methods:

	.. method:: context.set()

		Changes the current context to be the one represented by this context object.

	.. method:: context.prnt(string)

		Does the same as the :func:`prnt` function but in the given context.

	.. method:: context.emit_print(event_name, \*args)

		Does the same as the :func:`emit_print` function but in the given context.

	.. method:: context.command(string)

		Does the same as the :func:`command` function but in the given context

	.. method:: context.get_info(type)

		Does the same as the :func:`get_info` function but in the given context.

	.. method:: context.get_list(type)

		Does the same as the :func:`get_list` function but in the given context.
